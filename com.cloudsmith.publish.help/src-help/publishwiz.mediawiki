=The Publish Repository Wizard=
The 'Publish Repository Wizard' is displayed when invoking the 'Publish' action from the 'File' menu, or toolbar.

# On the first page, specify the directory where you want the published material to be generated.
# Press 'Finish'

A status page will appear indicating success or failure. If the publishing was successful the status page shows
the location of the generated repository; it is found in a sub-directory under the given directory from step 1 above.
The sub directory is named after the unit marked with 'is RepositoryDefinition' in the published file. The name of the sub-folder reflects both the name and the version, and special characters have been replaced.

In case of errors, there are details that show the cause of the problems.

===Unsatisfied Requirements===
If the publishing process detects unsatisfied requirements a warning page with the details (requiring unit and requirement) are shown at the end of the process. The resulting repository is then not self contained, and needs to be combined with content from other repositories to enable installation. If the intent was to create a self contained repository please check and correct the requirement (name and/or version range) and republish.
